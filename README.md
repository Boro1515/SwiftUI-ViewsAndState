# SwiftUI-ViewsAndState

This is a basic SwiftUI mini project demonstrating:

- Use of `@State` to store view state
- Cycling through an array of messages with a button
- Styling buttons with background, corner radius, and border
- Basic layout with `VStack`
- Use of `NavigationStack` and `navigationTitle`
- Animation when the message changes
- Light/Dark mode support using `.primary` color
- Responsive layout with `.frame` and `.systemBackground`

## Preview

The app displays an animal name from a list. Tapping the styled button cycles through the list endlessly.

This is part of my personal SwiftUI learning series, where I demonstrate modern UI development practices in small, clean examples.
